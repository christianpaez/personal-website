Being ambidextrous, the ability to use both hands equally well, is a fascinating and rare trait. Most of us are either right-handed or left-handed, but there's a select group of individuals who have the unique capability to switch effortlessly between both hands. In this blog, I will share my personal journey towards becoming ambidextrous and the remarkable experiences and challenges that came with it.

### A Chance Discovery

My journey into ambidexterity began with an unexpected twist. I was working in an office job that demanded long hours of computer use. One day, out of boredom, I decided to switch my mouse to my non-dominant hand - the left. Little did I know that this seemingly inconsequential decision would set me on a path of discovery and self-improvement.

### The Initial Struggles

As I began practicing using my left hand for the mouse, I encountered the initial struggles one might expect. My movements were clumsy, and it felt like learning to write all over again. Yet, I persisted, fueled by the challenge. And the boredom of a repetitive office job, of course.

### Exploring Ambidextrous Abilities

As I became more comfortable using my non-dominant hand for the mouse, I decided to experiment with everyday tasks like teeth brushing and eating. These simple actions suddenly felt like new challenges. It was fascinating to see how my brain adapted and developed to accommodate these changes.

### The Writing Challenge

Handwriting was hard. As a physics student at the time, taking notes and solving complex equations required legible writing. I forced myself to practice writing with my non-dominant hand nonetheless. The experience was frustrating at first, but gradually, I got better. The improvement was slower than eating and simpler actions, but still.

### **Writing Commitment**

I went a step further and began signing everything - from payment receipts to contracts - using my left hand. At first, it was funny to sign things because it took me a bit of time to use a pen left-handed, and I assume people wondered, "Why does he write so slow?" But I stuck with it.

### **The Benefits**

As my journey progressed, I began to find the benefits of being ambidextrous. I could use my left hand for pretty much everything, without thinking or struggling. One day, it dawned on me just how far I had come on this when I sat down at my drum kit, and to my surprise, playing with both hands felt entirely natural. Each hand had its own rhythm, and I did not have to think about what I was doing; it just felt right. It was a moment of realization for sure. Another benefit I can think of is being able to switch hands when using the computer. I work at home, and being ambidextrous allows me to reduce stress on a given wrist by letting it rest.
