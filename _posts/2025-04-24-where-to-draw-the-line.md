Anne Katherine’s *Where To Draw The Line* is a powerful guide to setting healthy boundaries — a skill that’s crucial for maintaining meaningful and respectful relationships. I found it especially insightful for the following reasons:

### Universally Relevant

This is a great read for everyone, simply because relationships are a fundamental part of being human. Whether with friends, family, coworkers, or partners, the book speaks to dynamics we all navigate.

### Packed With Scenarios

One of the book’s strengths is its abundance of real-life scenarios. These examples help readers understand boundary-setting in practical terms, making the lessons easier to apply in everyday life.

### Boosts Self-Esteem

Setting boundaries isn’t just about saying no — it’s about valuing yourself. This book does an excellent job of showing how strong boundaries can lead to improved self-esteem, self-respect, and emotional well-being.

### Personal Takeaway

I think this book is an essential tool for anyone looking to improve their relationships and sense of self. Anne Katherine’s compassionate yet clear approach makes complex emotional territory feel manageable. *Where To Draw The Line* is both an empowering read and a practical guide to personal growth.
