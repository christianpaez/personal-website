Jessie Inchauspe’s *Glucose Revolution* takes a fascinating deep dive into the role of blood sugar in our daily lives. It’s part science, part self-help — and totally eye-opening. Here’s what I appreciated most:

### Myth-Busting on Carbs

The book does an excellent job of debunking common myths around carbohydrates. Inchauspe breaks things down in a way that clears up a lot of confusion, especially around “good vs. bad” carbs and how blood sugar really works.

### A Blend of Science and Psychology

What makes this book stand out is how it weaves hard science with human behavior. Inchauspe explains the biology clearly, but also dives into why we make certain food choices — making it as much about psychology as physiology.

### Practical and Easy to Apply

This isn’t just theory. The tips in *Glucose Revolution* are surprisingly easy to work into your everyday life. From changing the order of your meals to adding a little vinegar — the advice is doable and effective for the average person.

### Personal Takeaway

This book reshaped how I think about food and energy. Jessie Inchauspe delivers scientific insight without the jargon, and the result is a guide that’s as readable as it is actionable. Highly recommended for anyone curious about health, habits, and feeling better day-to-day.
