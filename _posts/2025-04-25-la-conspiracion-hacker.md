*Conspiración Hacker* by Rubén H. Ríos is a compelling look into the underground world of hacking and cracking, mixing history, psychology, and tech culture into a focused narrative. Here's what makes it worth reading:

### Solid History of Hacking

The book provides a well-rounded summary of the history of hacking — from its early roots to its modern-day influence. It’s a great way to understand where digital subcultures came from and how they’ve evolved.

### Explores Hacker Motivation

Beyond the technical side, the book dives into the *why*. What drives someone to hack? What separates a hacker from a cracker? These questions are answered with nuance and insight.

### Niche but Insightful

This isn’t a mainstream tech book — and that’s what makes it special. It speaks to a niche audience but offers universal takeaways about curiosity, rebellion, and innovation.

### Personal Takeaway

The book shifted how I view hacking — not just as a threat or crime, but as a key part of how technology has grown. It’s about problem-solving, freedom, and pushing boundaries.

### Favorite Thing About It

What fascinated me most was learning that hackers (not crackers) have played a huge role in shaping modern tech. That piece of history doesn’t get told enough — and this book tells it well.
