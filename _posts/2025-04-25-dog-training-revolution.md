This book changed the way I see training — not as a chore, but as an opportunity to connect. It gave me both confidence and clarity in how I approach time with my dog.

### Favorite Thing About It

What I loved most is how it made me realize that training and bonding with my dog could be *simple* and genuinely enjoyable. It turned the process into something to look forward to.
